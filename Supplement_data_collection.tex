\section{Data Collection for Batting Statistics}

Baseball-Reference Win Above Replacement(bWAR) is collected from the website: \url{https://www.baseball-reference.com/data/war_daily_bat.txt}, which is stored in batters\_bWAR.csv. 

\bigskip

Fangraphs Win Above Replacement(fWAR) is scraped from the website: \url {https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=al&qual=0&type=c,4,5,6,23,58&season=2021&month=0&season1=2021&ind=0&team=0&rost=&age=&filter=&players=&startdate=&enddate=}, which is stored in batters\_fWAR.csv
